# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## Overview
This project focuses on conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the cleaned Tech Layoffs Dataset from COVID-19 to Present. The dataset was previously cleaned in my Data Cleaning Project using MySQL. The goal of this analysis is to identify trends, patterns, and insights regarding layoffs in the tech industry over time.

### Dataset
* Source: Cleaned dataset from my previous Data Cleaning Project

### Technologies Used
* Database: MySQL
* Querying Language: SQL

### Exploratory Data Analysis Process
1. Understanding Percentage of layoffs
2. Understanding the Total Layoffs based on...
   * Country
   * Location
   * Date
   * Industry
   * Stage
   * Company
3. Understanding the Rolling Total of Layoffs per Month
4. Ranking per year of Layoffs

### Installation & Setup
* Ensure MySQL is installed and running.
* Import the cleaned dataset into MySQL.
* Run the provided SQL queries for analysis.

### Insights & Findings
* The most affected industries were Hardware and Transportation. 
* The highest layoffs occurred in 2024, with 152,104 total layoffs.
* The top affected countries were United States with 139,400 total layoffs, India with 14,471 total layoffs, and Germany with 13,108 total layoffs.

### Future Improvements
* Perform predictive analysis on future layoff trends.
* Visualize data in Tableau/Power BI for better insights.
* Integrate Python for deeper statistical analysis.
